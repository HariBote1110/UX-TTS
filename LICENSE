GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you must
 have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
 or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
 you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) asserting copyright on the software, and (2) offering you this
 License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
 developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern
 of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individual use, which is
 precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
 version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
 problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend
 this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed
 to protect the freedom of users.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 make special effort to protect free software's users and developers from
 the danger of patents.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
 an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
 the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
 the Program.

 To "propagate" a work means doing anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.

 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
 the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
 a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
 widely used among developers working in that language.

 The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a non-source work means all the source
 code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and to
 modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
 However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or generally
 available tools or generally available free programs which are used
 unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of
 the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
 definition files associated with source files for the work, and the
 source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
 that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate
 data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
 parts of the work.

 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
 regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

 The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form needs to
 include any copyright notice and licensing information held by the
 original authors, in an easily readable (human and machine readable)
 form, given that all recipients are to be treated as licensees under
 this License.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

 You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
 without condition so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
 You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
 them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
 facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
 terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
 control the copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

 Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
 conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 makes it unnecessary.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
 laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

 When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing your own or third
 party legal rights against the work's users.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

 You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 the Program to produce such a work, in the form of source code under
 the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
 and giving a relevant date.

 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
 released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
 This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
 all notices".

 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
 to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
 therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
 to the whole of the work and all its parts, regardless of how they are
 packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any
 other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you received
 it separately.

 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
 Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
 interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
 need not make them do so.

 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 parts of the aggregate.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 Corresponding Source in a medium customarily used for software interchange.

 The Corresponding Source need not include any code, script or data that
 you can exclude under section 1 on the basis that it was generated
 automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

 The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form must be
 included in an archive format that is suitable for transferring
 software (for instance, a tar file compressed with gzip). However, it
 need not include production of a command-line interface, or an embedded
 operating system, or other facilities that are required for a recipient
 to use the work, but which are not part of the work itself.

 The recipient must be able to install and run the modified object code
 and use the Corresponding Source, using tools and procedures standard
 for the community to which the work belongs.

 7. Additional Terms.

 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions to one or more of its conditions.
 "Non-permissive additional terms" are terms that do not make
 exceptions. They may be included in the Program's source code, but not
 in its object code form.

 You may place additional permissions on one or more portions of the
 Program's source code, provided that you add an appropriate copyright
 notice to each portion and a notice that refers to this License.

 You may convey a covered work, if you have received permission from
 the copyright holder of the Program, under any terms you wish.
 Otherwise, you must not use additional permissions to deny or limit
 the user's rights under this License.

 8. Termination.

 You may not propagate or convey a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 convey it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under this License)
 for that work.

 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
 from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
 unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
 terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
 fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior
 to 60 days after the cessation.

 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this being the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.

 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 material under section 10.

 9. Acceptance.

 You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy of
 the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring merely
 as a consequence of using an electronic network to access public data
 does not require acceptance of this License. However, nothing other
 than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any
 covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
 this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
 you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License. You may not impose any
 further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted herein. You
 are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.

 11. Patents.

 A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
 work thus licensed is called the "contributor version".

 A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by making, using, or
 selling their contributor version, but do not include claims that would
 be infringed only by further modification of the contributor version.
 For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 this License.

 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
 use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
 the contents of its contributor version.

 In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue
 for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party
 means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
 against the party.

 If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license in
 which the patent license is conditioned on your not granting patent
 license to third parties, you grant an automatic patent license to all
 downstream recipients to the full extent of the patent license and the
 requirements of this License. This includes, but is not limited to, the
 full scope of the essential patent claims of any contributor.

 If you convey a covered work, and you do not know whether a patent
 license is conditioned on your not granting patent license to third
 parties, you grant an automatic patent license to all downstream
 recipients to the full extent of the patent license and the requirements
 of this License. This includes, but is not limited to, the full scope of
 the essential patent claims of any contributor.

 If you convey a covered work, and you do not know whether a patent
 license is conditioned on your not granting patent license to third
 parties, you grant an automatic patent license to all downstream
 recipients to the full extent of the patent license and the requirements
 of this License. This includes, but is not limited to, the full scope of
 the essential patent claims of any contributor.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

 If you distribute copies of the Program, you must make sure that they
 too receive or can get the source code. You must also make sure that they
 receive or can get a copy of this License.

 13. General Provisions.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
 specifies that a certain numbered version of this License "or any later
 version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
 published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
 specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
 ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of this License
 "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
 terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later
 version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
 not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
 ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 14. Limitation of Liability.

 The Free Software Foundation and its licensors disclaim all liability
 for any damages arising out of your use or inability to use the Program.

 15. Indemnification.

 The Free Software Foundation and its licensors disclaim all liability
 for any damages arising out of your use or inability to use the Program.

 16. Waiver.

 If you violate this License, the Free Software Foundation and its
 licensors reserve the right to pursue all available remedies, including
 termination of your license, to the full extent permitted by law.

 17. Entire Agreement.

 This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Free
 Software Foundation regarding the Program, and supersedes all prior
 agreements and understandings.

 18. Severability.

 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
 unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and
 effect.

 19. Governing Law.

 This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States of
 America, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
 courts of the United States of America.

 20. Notices.

 You must retain all copyright notices and other proprietary
 designations in the Program. You must also include in the source code
 a copy of this License and a notice that refers to the License.
